Log2xml README

2016-10-21



Log2xml python package is a schema based GNSS site log file
parser and GeodesyML XML validator and writer.

Log2xml relies on PYXB for schema valiation and
XML writing.

        1. eGeodesy.py     # PYXB binding
        2. iso3166.py      # country code
        3. log2xml.py      # parser and writer
        4. logging.conf    # logging configuration

PYXB 1.2.5 (http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/index.html)
which requires Python version 2.6 or higher including 3.x,
need to be installed, and with bundle generated.



Limited by PYXB's capabilities, following GeodesyML's schemas
have to be modified locally.

        1. equipment.xsd
        2. geodesyML.xsd
        3. geodeticEquipment.xsd
        4. geodeticMonument.xsd
        5. monumentInfo.xsd

The modified set of schemas has been encluded in the GIT repository.



How to generate PyXB bundles?

First, generate ALL bundles

   % export PYXB_ROOT=PyXB-1.2.5          # Where you extracted the source files

   % cd ${PYXB_ROOT}

   % pyxb/bundles/opengis/scripts/genbind

Then, install PyXB with all bundles generated

   % cd ${PYXB_ROOT}

   % python setup.py install --user       # PyXB will be installed at ${HOME}/.local



How to generate PyXB bindings?

   % ${HOME}/.local/bin/pyxbgen
          -u ~/dev/geodesy/GeodesyML/schemas/geodesyML.xsd   # pointing to schema
          -m eGeodesy                                        # module name
          --archive-path      ${HOME}/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyxb/bundles/common/raw:${HOME}/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyxb/bundles/opengis/raw:.:+
                                                             # where the bundles are
